# learning c++

Exactly as it is titled, this is a bunch of test cases to step-by-step learn various parts of c++.

This repository contains some notes in my own words as a personal reference in the future.

I began following the [CodingMadeEasy](https://www.youtube.com/user/CodingMadeEasy/playlists) video tutorials.

The first half of the c++ section was like a refresher course supplementing my college class, but there was some good stuff in them.

I am now working my way through the [sfml](http://www.sfml-dev.org/) tutorial (as an alternative to SDL with OpenGL on my mind).  I am enjoying it quite a bit, and next I will be following the platformer tutorial.
