# learning c++

Exactly as it is titled, this is a bunch of test cases to step-by-step learn various parts of c++.

This repository contains some notes in my own words as a personal reference in the future.

Finished watching and writing a bunch of C++ and SFML tutorials and test cases.

Next up is the [CodingMadeEasy SFML Platformer Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCB3138ADCE90F2EC), which I will check out hopefully soon.

I also have my own list of interests to invest some time into.


## tasklist

- game
- editors
- ai
- deduplication
    - dirwalk /w sha256 hash generation for simple file deduplication
        - group by size, then perform hash comparisons where groups have > 1 files
